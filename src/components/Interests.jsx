      Software quality, scalability and Service Oriented Architecture are subjects that fascinate me. I do my best to improve myself in these fields but I also try to open my perspective to other domains like compilation and static analysis.

      Generally speaking, I love working and sharing on topics related to software architecture and software quality. I like to see myself as a passionate developer, an Open Source enthusiast and an eternal learner.
